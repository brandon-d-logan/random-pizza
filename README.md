# Random Avalanche Pizza Script
My random pizza script for Avalanche Pizza (http://avalanchepizza.net/menu/) in Athens, OH.

# Background
Avalanche Pizza has so many amazing combinations, I got tired of having to make a decision when I ordered pizza. I wrote this script to easily make the choice a little less daunting, and if you don't like what gets picked, just run it again.

Authored initial script. Published on pastebin (https://pastebin.com/FdBRuZpD)
I have compiled a handy little bookmarklet to run the script without opening up the console.

Set up repository to share with friends. Bookmarklet created so console is no longer needed to execute.
